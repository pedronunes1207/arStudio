# WebGLStudio #

Welcome to the guide to understand and use WebGLStudio.

First of all remind you that this is a work-in-progress project that at this moment is maintained by a single person,
and due to the scope of the project it is still in a beta state. However we have been using it for several internal projects
with very good results.

## What is WebGLStudio? ##

WebGLStudio is an open-source 3D scene editor for the web, developed in Javascript, it includes its own 3D Engine
(for more information about the engine visit [LiteScene repository](https://github.com/jagenjo/litescene.js)) and other interesting features like code editing, resources managment, 
graph behaviours, animations, and a user-friendly interface.

It has been created so it is very modular and easy to expand do not forcing any rendering pipeline.

Any creation done in WebGLStudio could be easily shared online with a link or embeded in an existing website.

Creations could be packed in one single file so it is easy to store and share.

## But what can I do with it? ##

You can import assets from different sources (3D Meshes, textures, sounds, animations) and arrange them in a 3D Space.
Then you can edit their visual appearence, add behaviours through scripting in javascript or using the graph system, use HTML to create the interface, and when your scene is ready you can share it using one link.

## What if I'm an advanced user? ##

WebGLStudio allows to code your own shaders from the editor, create your own postprocessing effects, even redo the render pipeline.

## Who has developed WebGLStudio? ##

It has been developed by Javi Agenjo at the Interactive Technologies Group (GTI) at University Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona),
thanks to funding from the European Union and local institutions.

## Is there any tutorials, videos, books or content to learn how to use it? ##

Not yet, but I'm working on that.

## Which Licensing does it use? ##

It uses the MIT license, which means that you can use this software for whatever you want as long as you keep the same licensing.

You are free to install it in your server and modify it to your own purposes.
